nunjucks-brackets
=================

[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) syntax highlighter for [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).

This extension defines a new CodeMirror mode named `nunjucks`. The mode is combined with CodeMirror's existing HTML mixed mode, so that any HTML code placed inside a Nunjucks block gets properly highlighted. The `nunjucks` mode is mapped to the following file extensions:

- `html`
- `htm`
- `nunjucks`
- `njk`

Note that this is a very rough implementation, which is not meant to cover the entire Nunjucks grammar. Contributions most welcome.
